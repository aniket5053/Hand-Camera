Using mediapipe, I created a tool that tracks your hand to paint on the screen.

Once the program starts, the user has to move their hand towards the "Draw" button and then tap their Index Finger and Thumb together. There should be visual feedback that lets the user know the button has been clicked.

The default color to paint is blue but the user can select between a multitude of colors on the screen. They just have to hover over the color with their hand and by pressing their Index Finger and Thumb together they should select that color and put a black box around it as an indicator.

To erase the canvas, go to the "Erase" button

To stop drawing, press the "Stop" button
